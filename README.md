# Gatsby & Prismic starter project

This project is a starter template for a Gatsby project using Prismic as the CMS.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

To make sure this project will work, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. This is not a tutorial. It is a quick way of getting started with a project using best practices. If you don't understand how this works, [go back and follow this tutorial](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/tutorial-gatsby)

Install Prismic CLI globally on your system (if you don't already have it) and login

```
sudo npm install -g prismic cli
prismic login
```

### Installing

Now we've got the prismic-cli set up, we can run the following command to start installing the theme

```
prismic theme --ignore-conf
```

1. You will be prompted to select the url of the theme you want to use

  You can choose any prismic theme here but in this case you should use this repo

  ```
  https://github.com/danspratling/gatsby-starter-prismic/archive/main.zip
  ```

  **Note** You'll need to make sure you point to the zip version of the theme - the main URL won't work

2. Next name your repository. Choose whatever you'd like - we'll use `my-awesome-project`
  
  This will create your own custom project at `my-awesome-project.prismic.io` with some dummy data already populated
  
3. Finally, name the local file. Hit enter if you just want to use the same name as your repository

**Important**: By default, this repo will connect to **my** starter repo. That's great for making sure it doesn't break, but in order for the changes you make to show up you'll need to change `gatsby-config.js` to point at your newly created repo

Change the `gatsby-source-prismic` plugin `repositoryName` to your newly created repo
```
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-source-prismic',
  options: {
    repositoryName: 'my-awesome-repo', //change this to your repo name - don't include the prismic.io part of the url
    linkResolver: () => doc => linkResolver(doc),
    schemas: {
      homepage: require('./custom_types/homepage.json'),
      navigation: require('./custom_types/navigation.json'),
      page: require('./custom_types/page.json'),
    }
  }
}
```

Install the dependencies

```
yarn
```


#### Development

Start the development server

```
yarn start
```

Then go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Now if you go to `my-awesome-repo.prismic.io` and make some changes you should see them reflected in your project (you may need to restart the server)

**Important**: Remember, you'll need to change your `gatsby-config.js` to point at the correct repo!!


#### Testing

Start storybook to document and visually test your site

```
yarn storybook
```

Start cypress to e2e test your site

```
yarn cy:open
```
